# Design patterns implemented in Java
# Introduction

Design patterns are the best formalized practices a programmer can use to
solve common problems when designing an application or system.

Design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested, proven
development paradigms.

Reusing design patterns help prevent subtle issues that cause major
problems, and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who
are familiar with the patterns.
